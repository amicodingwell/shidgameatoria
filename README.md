SHIDGAMEATORIA

/* A small game where you say your name, race and class to get your basic stats, being:
    HEALTH, ATTACK DAMAGE, DEFENCE and EXPERIENCE.

The loop consists of a random encounter of an enemy that is pulled from the monsters.hpp file.
You then fight it, where:
    - attacking deals a random amount of damage between the top 30% of your attack stat, and 30% of the enemy's defence stat.
    - defending forgoes attacking but increases your defence to 70% of your defence stat vs their attack stat.
    - potion drinking heals you 30% of your maximum health.
    - damage received during an attack is 30% of your defence against their attack stat.

Afterwards you gain experience based on the max health of the enemy.
You can then choose to rest to heal you of 50% of your maximum health, or receive 3 potions.

Then the game loops.

When you die, there will be a screen saying:
        "You've fought well, but game over. Your experience is: "
        "Press any key to exit."

***Perhaps if I have the energy I'll add attack names to the monsters.
